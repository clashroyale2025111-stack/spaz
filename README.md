Computer Security Enthusiast, Python Developer, Web Exploitation Learner, and OSINT/Digital Forensics Hobbyist.  
I enjoy analysing systems, writing Python tools, and exploring how things break (and how to fix them). Currently learning web application security, red-teaming methodology, and practical pentesting techniques.

I’m passionate about:
- 🐍 Building Python scripts for automation, scraping, and security research  
- 🌐 Web security: XSS, SSRF, injections, and general web exploitation basics  
- 🕵️‍♂️ OSINT workflows, data collection, and digital footprint analysis  
- 🔍 Digital forensics and log/artefact analysis  
- 🛡️ Red-team concepts, attack paths, and blue-team detection ideas

A few things about me:
- 📚 Always learning new security concepts and improving my Python
- 💻 Interested in CTFs, labs, and real-world style challenges
- ✉️ Open to discussions about security, tools, or collabs
